# Remnant Save Guardian
Back up your Remnant 2 saves and view your world rolls.

**This project is a work in progress. Lots of features are broken or partially implemented.**

## Installation
1. Download and install the [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Razzmatazzz/RemnantSaveGuardian/releases/latest)
3. Unzip the latest release to a folder of your choosing (probably not the same folder where you have the game installed)
4. Run RemnantSaveGuardian.exe

## Known Issues
- Many events do not have the corresponding items they drop. It's a manual process to add those, so it will take some time.
- Many events and items do not have well-formatted names. Again, it's a manual process to add those.
- The world analyzer might not be updating automatically as it should be.
- Sometimes events from the campaign get incorrectly allocated to adventure


Thanks for @crackedmind for the inflation code to convert saves into partial plaintext. 

Thanks to AuriCrystal for event/item list.
